source of an "4KB executable graphics" entry (~3500 bytes)

https://demozoo.org/graphics/338623/  
https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=96220

initial commit is basically copied from one of my previous
entries (probably c-chord or dominoes), and I didn't clean
up anything before submitting :^) here be dragons

75% partycoded

this time with a correct executable name using 1080p
instead of 1920p like all of my previous releases (oops)

Not so fancy graphics, but they're on-topic :)
I should really look into how to do better lighting.
And also not postpone so much.

Shader source is /still/ not minified :^)

//// greetings & acknowledgements

Crinkler was used to link & compress the exe.

Greetings to everyone that does some form of
shader live coding (on twitch), sharing shaders
with explanation comments and stuff like that.

Big shoutout to iq, for their shader articles
and numerous example shaders.

File breakdown
--------------

- Crinkler/
	contains crinkler
- h.c
	source of the program, copied from a previous prod, probably
	c-chord (https://github.com/yugecin/c-chord) or dominoes,
	so acknowledgements go out to auld's "chocolux" demo,
	iq's 4k framework, and sleep deprivation
- frag.glsl
	source of the shader
- frag.glsl.c
	frag.glsl but exported to be a c string, removing debug things,
	generated by https://github.com/yugecin/ShaderThing2
- makedebug
	shell "script" to make a build, again just copied from previous prods
- overheadbytes-mountainprojector.nfo
	nfo file, basically a readme file that goes with the release
- readme.md
	you're reading it right now!
- reference.png
	rendered image of the final version


How 2 build the executable
--------------------------

Assuming a non-cmd terminal (git-bash or similar),
run ". makedebug", though you may need to edit the file to change the LIBPATH.

requires gcc


How frag.glsl.c is built
------------------------

Run https://github.com/yugecin/ShaderThing2 and open frag.glsl and press the
"export" button (in the main window - the one with the shader).

(Note that the tool might complain about a missing frag.glsl.pos file,
ignore that)
